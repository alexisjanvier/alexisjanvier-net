        <p class="attention-grabber">I initially worked from home as a design consultant but I
            always wanted to work in a full-time, on-site position. So I traded the comfort of home
            for a small office in a cosy little town in Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>Six years ago, I joined a tiny startup and it was the first time I experienced an
            open-plan office. There were only three other people working with me in that office and
            we really got along. We went to lunch together, took walks together, hung out in our
            free time and built a friendly relationship based on trust. My journey would then take
            me forward to London where I’d end up working for other, larger startups. Little did I
            know, that the tiny Luxembourgish company would be the only positive onsite working
            environment that I’d get to experience in my career.</p>
        <figure class="floatRight">

                <p>“No nesting!”, I’m told. I’m expected to move around, sit in different areas each
                    day.</p>

        <p class="force-indent">
            After working for a medium-sized startup in London I went on to work for an enterprise.
            The office was the most stylish compared to the previous ones, it was larger and in a
            recently-built skyscraper just the opposite of the Google headquarters. Beautiful views
            of downtown London on one side, similar skyscrapers on the other. Long rows of tables
            everywhere and busy-looking people slouching over their laptops. Lively and even
            somewhat noisy, but, surprisingly, it all looked strangely bleak. I learned on the first
            day that the company practices what they call “a clean desk policy”. This simply means
            that at the end of the day you need to pack your shit up, put it in a box and take it to
            your little American-high-school-looking locker. “No nesting!”, I’m told. I’m expected
            to move around, sit in different areas each day. It’s supposed to make me interact with
            different people in the company.
        </p>
        <h2 id="open-plan-offices-done-wrong">Open-plan offices done wrong</h2>
        <p>Corporations like these try to emulate the startup working environment by creating such
            open offices where they throw 100 people in and tell them to collaborate. They expect
            cross-pollination of ideas like we’re fucking bees or something. It’s not that simple.
            It kinda works for startups because the teams are usually really small. We’re talking
            about 5 to 7 people. Collaborating in an open-plan office is great when everyone is
            working on the same thing, when you’re all on the same mission, when you hang out with
            them during lunch time, go home together… But when you share your space with people who
            work on different things (sometimes even in different departments) that constantly
            distract you with their noisiness <em>and</em> nosiness it’s a completely different
            story.</p>

        <p>That’s what large companies that try to emulate startups get wrong the most. And the
            worst thing about it is that they <em>don’t even realise that they’re not getting
                it</em>. They just brag about their “<em>cool office</em>” and how “<em>we’re all
                about collaboration</em>” and “<em>flat hierarchy</em>”. They think that a cool
            office will create a great culture. That cleaning up your own desk everyday will force
            you to sit with Jeff from the sales department and get friendly with him to eventually
            share ideas and interests. Well, let me tell you something: Jeff is fucking annoying and
            I, as an introverted designer, have absolutely nothing in common with him. He’s nothing
            but a huge distraction to me. I can still hear him yap around on his call even through
            my headphones playing the loudest Death Metal music I can find.</p>
        <h3 id="collaboration-kills-creativity">Collaboration kills creativity</h3>
        <p>There was an interesting study called <em>Coding War Games</em> conducted by Tom Demarco
            which compared 600 computer programmers at 92 companies. Long story short, they
            found:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote"
                    rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>that people from the same companies performed at roughly the same level — but that
                there was an enormous performance gap between organizations. What distinguished
                programmers at the top-performing companies wasn’t greater experience or better pay.
                It was how much privacy, personal workspace and freedom from interruption they
                enjoyed. <em>Sixty-two percent of the best performers said their workspace was
                    sufficiently private compared with only 19 percent of the worst performers.</em>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There it is: <em>privacy, personal workspace</em> and <em>freedom from interruption</em>.
            These are the things that make programmers produce better work, not experience or higher
            salary. But it seems most companies rather <em>spend</em> money hiring highly
            experienced programmers, pay them high salaries and have them produce mediocre work
            because they want to <em>save</em> money on the office costs. Mindblowing.</p>
        <p>The only way to make the open-plan office work in larger companies would be to keep some
            walls between sections that divide the office into small working areas where people feel
            safe and, most of all, comfortable. To create small offices for teams of 5 to 7 people
            (who work on the same thing/project) where they can collaborate and work undisturbed.
            Some companies, including Facebook which was the largest advocate for open-plan offices,
            are starting to revert to something like that. I guess they finally figured out that
            open-plan offices don’t actually work. And there’s solid research to back that claim.
        </p>
        <h2 id="open-plan-offices-simply-dont-work">Open-plan offices simply don’t work</h2>
        <p>The idea behind the open-plan offices is to encourage collaboration, increase
            transparency, improve efficiency, and establish a great working relationship between the
            workers. To quote one of the loudest advocates of open-plan offices, Jack Dorsey,
            co-founder of Twitter:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We encourage people to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and
                people walking by each other teaching new things.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Even the small offices that are reserved for meetings and calls in these kinds of
            environments are usually surrounded by transparent walls. So even when you’re trying to
            isolate yourself a bit, everyone can still see you. I guess it’s all in the name of
            transparency. Collaboration, transparency, efficiency and friendship at work all sounds
            nice, but is there any research backing this?</p>
        <p>There’s research alright, but it’s not backing the claims of the open-plan office
            advocates. In fact, it proves the opposite. Researches at Harvard found that after
            switching to an open-plan office:<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2"
                    class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Overall, face-to-face time decreased by around 70 percent across the participating
                employees, on average, with email use increasing by between 22 percent and 50
                percent…</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I experienced this myself. I’ve seen people who were sitting opposite of each other
            communicating through chat messages. All day long. Interestingly, both were wearing
            noise-cancelling headphones. When I saw that, I felt that it was something that’s
            perfectly fine to do and adopted it. Another study found that:<sup id="fnref:3"
                role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>…many workers in open offices are frustrated by distractions that lead to poorer work
                performance. Nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of
                sound privacy was a significant problem for them and more than 30 percent complained
                about the lack of visual privacy.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>and that:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>…the loss of productivity due to noise distraction … was doubled in open-plan offices
                compared to private offices.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This answers <em>why</em> I always felt so anxious in these types of offices. Being an
            introvert, I found it extremely hard to isolate myself in such noisy environments.
            Especially because they’re noisy in a bad way. It’s not the same as working in a coffee
            shop where everything blends into the background. And then here’s the final nail in the
            coffin for the open-plan offices:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>While employees feel like they’re part of a laid-back, innovative enterprise, the
                environment ultimately damages workers’ attention spans, productivity, creative
                thinking, and satisfaction. Furthermore, a sense of privacy boosts job performance,
                while the opposite can cause feelings of helplessness.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ok, so if research proves that open-plan offices don’t work, why are 80% of office
            working environments already open-plan? The amount of space per employee shrank from 50
            m<sup>2</sup> in 1970 to less than 20 m<sup>2</sup> in 2010<sup id="fnref:4"
                role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
            Switching to an open-plan office is a global trend. Why do companies increasingly keep
            switching to it if it doesn’t actually work?</p>
        <h2 id="the-new-sweatshops-of-the-west">The new sweatshops of the west</h2>
        <p>We look with horror at the typical sweatshops in Asia that, whether we like it or not,
            produce most of the products we buy. Rooms, crowded with people (and sometimes children)
            with no private space, trying to focus in such distracting and sometimes hazardous
            environment. Trying their best to produce the amount of work that will guarantee them
            their daily wage. Bad lighting, poor quality of air, limited toilet time, limited
            breaks. In short, extremely poor and unacceptable working conditions.</p>
        <p>But aren’t the open-plan offices similar? People sitting in rows of desks with very
            limited space, no privacy, trying their best but can’t focus because of the many
            distractions? Isn’t this similar to a sweatshop but with better working conditions? Yes,
            the offices look nice and stylish, there’s air conditioning, decent lighting and
            good-enough office equipment—most office workers don’t have access to ergonomic office
            equipment—but at closer inspection, it’s just a nicer sweatshop.</p>
        <p>Think about it from the employer’s perspective. An office in central London is extremely
            expensive. The best way to make use of it is to turn it into an open-plan office and
            fill it with as many people as possible. Give them perks to distract them from those
            feelings of unproductiveness, anxiousness and even helplessness, that research suggests
            they have. Sweatshops were a thing in the west one hundred years ago but it seems
            they’re making a come back only in a nicer, stylish form. Open-plan offices are nothing
            more than a sweatshop disguised as “environments that promote collaboration,
            transparency, [insert a bullshit corporate term here]…”</p>

            productive and most sane when I worked from home. That’s why after 5 years of
            distracting environments, limited efficiency, anxiety, helplessness and lack of control,
            I decided to <a
